 PID + PWM Ramping 
 
âœ… TRYING TO DO :
1)PID control with Kp, Ki, Kd

2)Smooth stop (deceleration + ramping): Deceleration zone to reduce speed as you approach the target

3)Position prediction with derivative.

4)Motor speed clamping (MIN_PWM to MAX_PWM)

5)EEPROM save/load

6)Limit switch handling
